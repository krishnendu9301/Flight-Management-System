# Flight-Management-System
📌 Project Overview

The Flight Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage flights, bookings, cancellations, and passenger data. It uses CSV files as storage, ensuring simplicity and portability, while leveraging Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for efficient data handling and visualization.

This system demonstrates how data-driven solutions can simplify airline operations by automating repetitive tasks, reducing errors, and providing meaningful analytical reports.

🚀 Features

Add Flights: Register new flights with airline name, route, timings, capacity, and fare.

View Flights: Display all available flights with details.

Book Tickets: Confirm seats if available; otherwise, place passengers on a waitlist.

Cancel Tickets: Cancel bookings with automatic promotion of waitlisted passengers.

View Bookings: Retrieve and display passenger bookings per flight or all flights.

Reports & Analytics:

Occupancy Pie Chart: Shows seat utilization (Confirmed, Waitlisted, Cancelled, Available).

Revenue Histogram: Displays revenue earned per flight.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas → Data handling & CSV management

NumPy → Numeric operations (seat assignment, capacity checks)

Matplotlib → Data visualization (charts & graphs)

📊 Sample Workflow

Add Flights → Create flight records in flights.csv.

Book Tickets → Book passengers; auto-manages waitlist if flight is full.

Cancel Tickets → Cancel a confirmed booking; waitlisted passenger (if any) is promoted.

Generate Reports → Visualize occupancy and revenue trends.

📈 Charts

Occupancy Pie Chart → Displays seat utilization status.

Revenue Histogram → Compares income generated by different flights.
